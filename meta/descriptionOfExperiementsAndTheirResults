Task: differentiate tweet popularity classes by their words.
Base case: 2 classes. Where to make the cut?
Well, if we do two classes, split in half, that has little semantic value, as the increase is very flat most of the way.
If we split at 90%, we get really the only spike at the end, but that leaves us with very little data from class 2.
If we split at 75%, we hit the start of the derivative increase, a good compromise.
